# hello-world
Yep, I am new on GitHub.

This is Deepak. I am a Data Analyst based in India and learning my way through to become a Data Scientinst. I have worked on SAS and SQL for years and have been working on Python for quite some time. Also, learnt some machine learning algorithms. However, I am think I still need to learn a lot; hence, wanted to connect with global community and learn more.
